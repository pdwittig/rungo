######This rails API serves as the backend for the rungo iOS app.

######Todo
- auth
- origin settings
  - need to populate lines(model/controller)
- get data from api (agency, routes, lines)
- cross ref geo coords with api data (will work with muni data only)
- create agency and lines controller

- cron jobs to kick off process
- google maps stuff
- a million other things


######Future things to worry about
- How am I going to geocode non muni stop data
- Refactor directionality issue in method that fetches stops from api
